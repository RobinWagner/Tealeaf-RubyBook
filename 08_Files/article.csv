"Al Franken Urges FBI To Prosecute ""Revenge Porn""",http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/4ocQ94Q_CFc/al-franken-urges-fbi-to-prosecute-revenge-porn,"mi contributes this excerpt from National Journal: ""Sen. Al Franken is urging the FBI to more quickly and aggressively pursue and respond to reports of revenge porn, marking a rare burst of attention on a controversial topic about which Congress has typically been quiet. In a letter to FBI Director James Comey, the Minnesota Democrat asked for more information about the agency's authority to police against revenge porn, or the act of posting explicit sexual content online without the subject's consent, often for purposes of humiliation and extortion. Its popularity has ballooned in recent years, and victims are disproportionately women.""

I have my own likes and dislikes, of course, and I'm sure everyone can appreciate things like getting credit for their work and always having the break room fridge stocked. But I'd like to hear about the other things, big and small, that make it more fun (or at least less un-fun) to come into work every day. This can be anything &mdash; methods of personal communication, HR policies (for example, how can reviews be not-terrible?), amenities at the office, computer hardware/software, etc. I also wouldn't mind advice on how to represent my team when dealing with other departments.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Building an NES Emulator,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/F0a23Ep6SFU/building-an-nes-emulator,"An anonymous reader writes: Programmer Michael Fogleman recently built his own emulator for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. He's now put up a post sharing many technical insights he learned along the way. For example: ""The NES used the MOS 6502 (at 1.79 MHz) as its CPU. The 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed in 1975. ... The 6502 had no multiply or divide instructions. And, of course, no floating point. There was a BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) mode but this was disabled in the NES version of the chip&mdash;possibly due to patent concerns. The 6502 had a 256-byte stack with no overflow detection. The 6502 had 151 opcodes (of a possible 256). The remaining 105 values are illegal / undocumented opcodes. Many of them crash the processor. But some of them perform possibly useful results by coincidence. As such, many of these have been given names based on what they do."" It's an interesting look at how software and hardware interacted back then, and what it takes to emulate that in modern times. Fogleman released the source code on GitHub.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

It turns out U.S. automakers don't agree &mdash; they filed opposition comments through trade associations. ""They say you shouldn't be allowed to repair your own car because you might not do it right.

Microsoft Engineer: Open Source Windows Is 'Definitely Possible',http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/z9TRsLqWGNM/microsoft-engineer-open-source-windows-is-definitely-possible,"An anonymous reader writes: Speaking at ChefCon, Microsoft Technical Fellow Mark Russinovich talked briefly about the prospect of some or all of Windows going open source. He said, ""It's definitely possible. It's a new Microsoft."" Russinovich acknowledged the reality that most developers and IT workers have embraced open source software to run some or all of their machines, and that means Microsoft needs to adapt. He also noted that Microsoft is beginning to adopt a strategy familiar to open source vendors: give away the software, and then sell support and related products. ""It lifts them up and makes them available for our other offerings, where otherwise they might not be. If they're using Linux technologies that we can't play with, they can't be a customer of ours.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Microsoft To Stop Enabling 'Do Not Track' By Default,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/NJ9vkl0jLqI/microsoft-to-stop-enabling-do-not-track-by-default,"An anonymous reader writes: The history of the do-not-track setting for web browsers has been rife with debate. It took a long time for web experts to come to anything resembling a consensus on how it should be implemented, and the process isn't over yet. Microsoft took criticism for enabling the do-not-track setting by default in Internet Explorer. While it sounds good in theory, many worried it would just spur websites to completely disregard the setting (and some, like Yahoo, did just that). Now, Microsoft has reversed their stance. The do-not-track setting will not be enabled by default in the company's future browsers. They say, ""Put simply, we are updating our approach to DNT to eliminate any misunderstanding about whether our chosen implementation will comply with the W3C standard. ... As a result, DNT will not be the default state in Windows Express Settings moving forward, but we will provide customers with clear information on how to turn this feature on in the browser settings should they wish to do so.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

He describes the mood after the leaks: ""My sense of it was that there were two overriding emotions among the workforce. The first was a deep, deep [feeling] of betrayal. Someone who was sitting next to them&mdash;being part of the team helping keep people safe, which is really what people at the agency think they are doing&mdash;could turn around and do something so self-aggrandizing and reckless. There was also a deep sense of hurt that a lot of what was in the media was not entirely accurate. Questioning the motives and legality of what NSA employees were being asked to do to keep Americans safe&mdash;all within the legal policy construct that we've been given&mdash;that was difficult for the NSA workforce.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The Democratization of Medical Diagnosis and Discovery,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Q5LYWPReNqY/the-democratization-of-medical-diagnosis-and-discovery,"An anonymous reader writes: As wearable fitness devices become popular, we're seeing the beginning of a change in how untrained people can monitor their own health. On top of that, we also have access now to powerful data-sharing tools &mdash; if a patient has the means and the interest to look at the data from a doctor's medical scans, she can. A post at the NY Times argues this is leading to the democratization of medical discovery. Physicians and researchers are now saying, ""Better-informed patients ... are more likely to take better care of themselves, comply with prescription drug regimens and even detect early-warning signals of illness."" These tools also allow easier aggregation of data from large groups of patients (hopefully anonymized), which can provide more accurate assessments of the typical course of disease than current methods, which often rely on interpretations of interpretations.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The Unlikely Effort To Build a Clandestine Cell Phone Network,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/_ekzFIgbI24/the-unlikely-effort-to-build-a-clandestine-cell-phone-network,"Lashdots writes: Electronic surveillance has raised concerns among Americans and pushed an estimated 30% of them to protect their privacy in some form. Artist Curtis Wallen has taken that effort to dramatic lengths, documenting how to create a ""clandestine communications network"" using pre-paid phones, Tor, Twitter, and encryption. The approach, which attempts to conceal any encryption that could raise suspicions, is ""very passive"" says Wallen, so ""there's hardly any trace that an interaction even happened."" This is not easy, of course. In fact, as he discovered while researching faulty CIA security practices, it's really, comically hard. ""If the CIA can't even keep from getting betrayed by their cell phones, what chance do we have?"" he says. Still, he believes his system could theoretically keep users' activities hidden, and while it's hard, it's not impossible.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Why the Framework Nuclear Agreement With Iran Is Good For Both Sides,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/SuJ9KCav8BA/why-the-framework-nuclear-agreement-with-iran-is-good-for-both-sides,"Lasrick writes: Ariane Tabatabai breaks down the details of the framework agreement between Iran and the P5+1 that was announced Thursday. It appears to be better than most analysts expected, with positive outcomes for both sides. It truly seems historic: ""A number of these steps will, in effect, be irreversible. They will not just limit Iran's nuclear capability for 10 to 15 years, but will reshape it entirely and indefinitely. ... [B]oth sides stand to gain from the framework agreement, which should also be considered a victory for the global nonproliferation regime. Ahead of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference that begins in late April, where no major achievements in nonproliferation are likely to be announced, the framework agreement is a very important success.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
